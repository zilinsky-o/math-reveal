# Math Picture Reveal Game

**Version:** 1.6.1  
**Created for:** Elementary-age children (designed for a 9-year-old)

An engaging educational math game that combines addition practice with collectible mechanics and progressive difficulty to maintain motivation and track learning progress.

---

## üéÆ Game Overview

Players solve addition problems to reveal hidden pictures by progressively uncovering an 8√ó8 grid (64 cells). Each revealed picture is added to a persistent collection with rarity-based rewards. The game features four levels with increasing difficulty and targeted practice modes.

---

## üìö Level System

### Level 1: Practice Addition (2-9)
- **Focus:** Single-digit addition (2+2 through 9+9)
- **Grid:** 8√ó8 cells, each representing one addition problem
- **Mechanics:** 6 random cells progress per correct answer
- **Tracking:** Records mistakes and slow responses (20+ seconds) for Level 2

### Level 2: Practice Challenging Questions (from Level 1)
- **Focus:** Targeted remediation of Level 1 difficulties
- **Questions:** Problems that had mistakes OR took 20+ seconds
- **Minimum:** 10 questions (fills with slowest responses if needed)
- **Grid:** 64 cells with proportional progression (64/X cells per answer, where X = number of practice questions)
- **Theme:** Golden/orange visual theme

### Level 3: Double-Digit Addition
- **Focus:** Adding numbers 11-90 with single digits 2-9
- **Grid:** 8√ó8 cells with random cell progression
- **Mechanics:** 6 random cells progress per correct answer
- **Tracking:** Records mistakes and slow responses for Level 4
- **Theme:** Green visual theme

### Level 4: Practice Challenging Questions (from Level 3)
- **Focus:** Targeted remediation of Level 3 difficulties
- **Questions:** Problems that had mistakes OR took 20+ seconds
- **Minimum:** 10 questions (fills with slowest responses if needed)
- **Grid:** 64 cells with proportional progression
- **Theme:** Blue/indigo visual theme

## üéØ Core Mechanics

### Cell Reveal System
Each cell has 3 states:
1. **Covered** (0 correct) - Fully opaque pink/gold/green/blue cover
2. **Cracked** (1 correct) - 70% opacity with visible crack pattern
3. **Revealed** (2 correct) - Transparent, picture visible

### Question Flow
- **Correct Answer:** 
  - Levels 1 & 3: Progress 6 random incomplete cells
  - Levels 2 & 4: Progress cells proportionally (64 √∑ question count)
  - Play success sound (or cell reveal sound if cells completed)
  
- **Wrong Answer:**
  - Regress cells using same logic
  - Clear input box for retry
  - Track mistake for reports and practice levels
  - Schedule retry after 2 other questions (Levels 1 & 3 only)

### Timer & Tracking
- Timer starts when question displays
- Paused time excluded from total
- Speed categories:
  - **Fast:** < 5 seconds (reported as achievement)
  - **Normal:** 5-20 seconds
  - **Slow:** 20+ seconds (used for practice level selection)

## üé® Collectibles System

### Collection Mechanics
- One collectible earned per level completion
- 50 unique animals with emojis
- Persistent storage via localStorage
- Animals can be collected multiple times (shows count badge)
- Rarity-based rewards with progression bonuses

### Rarity Tiers
1. **Common** (60% base) - Light gray background
2. **Uncommon** (25% base) - Light green background
3. **Rare** (10% base) - Light blue background
4. **Epic** (4% base) - Light purple background
5. **Legendary** (1% base) - Light yellow background

### Rarity Progression
- Each level completed increases chances for rarer items
- Formula: +2% per level distributed to Rare/Epic/Legendary
- Highest level completed tracked in localStorage

### Animal Examples
- **Common:** Cat, Dog, Pig, Bee, Butterfly, Frog
- **Uncommon:** Bear, Fox, Penguin, Hedgehog, Owl
- **Rare:** Lion, Dolphin, Elephant, Koala, Shark
- **Epic:** Whale, Tiger, Rhino
- **Legendary:** Unicorn, Dinosaur, T-Rex

## üìä Reporting System

End-of-level reports show:

### Achievement Report (Green)
- Questions answered in under 5 seconds
- Shows average time for each fast question
- Sorted by speed (fastest first)

### Mistakes Report (Yellow)
- Questions with incorrect answers
- Shows mistake count per question
- Sorted by mistake count (most mistakes first)

### Slow Response Report (Yellow)
- Questions taking 20+ seconds
- Shows average time for each slow question
- Sorted by time (slowest first)

### Perfect Score
- Displays if no mistakes and no slow responses

## üéµ Audio System

Uses Web Audio API with tone generation:

1. **Success Sound** - Three ascending tones (C5, E5, G5)
2. **Cell Reveal Sound** - Four ascending tones (C5, E5, G5, C6)
3. **Fail Sound** - Two descending tones (G4, F4)
4. **Completion Sound** - Extended 10-note victory melody

All sounds use sine waves at 30% volume.

  ```javascript
  {
    emoji: "ü¶Ñ",
    name: "Unicorn", 
    rarity: "legendary",
    count: 2,
    firstFound: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",

## üéì Educational Design Principles

1. **Spaced Repetition** - Wrong answers re-appear after 2 questions
2. **Targeted Practice** - Practice levels focus on challenging problems
3. **Non-Punitive** - Mistakes help learning, always allow progress
4. **Immediate Feedback** - Visual and audio cues for all actions
5. **Progress Visibility** - Clear indicators of progress and achievement
6. **Motivation** - Collection mechanics and rarity system encourage completion
7. **Adaptive Difficulty** - Minimum question counts ensure sufficient practice
